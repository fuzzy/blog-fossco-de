* Org-mode configuration

When we left off in part #01 of our series, we had defined a framework for adding "layers" to our configuration. As well, we had defined two layers, a "base" and a "rss" layer, and setup the configurations. I'm assuming you have read the first part of the series, so I'm going to continue building on that base config that we built.

In this article we'll be setting up our base org-mode configuration, some extras and things to make org even nicer than it already is. Which is honestly saying something. We'll begin by adding a directory, "mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/local/org" should do that just fine if you're on a UNIX or UNIX-like system. Our imports.el file inside would look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq package-list '(org-plus-contrib
                     org-bullets
                     org-beautify-theme
                     org-pomodoro))
#+END_SRC
