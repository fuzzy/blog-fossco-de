#+TITLE: A self-contained and portable home directory

* Synopsis

I have a *LOT* of machines in my home network. Some are your standard off-the-shelf PC types, x86_64(amd64) stuff mainly,
although I do have 2 i686 machines (eeePCs displaying monitoring stats). I also have a [[https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/what-is-a-plethora.gif?w=650][plethora]] of ARM machines, both
32 and 64 bit (armv6/7 and aarch64[arm64] respectively). I currently use a RockPro64 as my main desktop machine, but it fluctuates
based on stuff like, "what arm board am I playing with atm?" "is it a day that ends in 'y'?" "do I have anything better to do?".
You know, normal stuff. Anyhow, it's obvious that I'm only able to do this and still get things done, one of two ways: 1) I get really
good at or automate my local environment setup (install anything I might need, check out my normal repos, setup configurations etc).
or 2) I have a portable setup that I can cart around either via some mechanism like NFS (or any shared network filesystem) or an external
drive.

* Goals

1. Create an external drive that contains the home directory setup
2. Ensure tools are installed in a os/arch agnostic manner
3. Ensure a consistent toolset across all os/arch combinations
4. Provide a backup and recovery mechanism

* Tools

1. POSIX sh (we'll be writing all of our automation to the lowest common denominator)
2. Git (gonna be needing this thing)
3. C/C++ Compiler toolchain and dev tools

* Getting started
