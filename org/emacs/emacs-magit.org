* Emacs Git Integration

We'll be using Magit, and let me tell you, I have barely scratched the surface of the functionality Magit has, and it is already the greatest thing since the invention of inventions.

| Name  |       Version | Home             |

Our base imports are simple, as we only import magit at this time, so our *~/.emacs.d/local/git/imports.el* file would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq package-list '(magit))
#+END_SRC

And our only configuration item is a keybinding to fit our conventions, so our *~/.emacs.d/local/git/config.el* file would look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'magit)
(define-key thwap-map (kbd "g s") 'magit-status)
#+END_SRC

Finally, we need to make sure that our *git* layer is present in our thwap/layers variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(setq thwap/layers '("base"
                     "rss"
                     "git"))
#+END_SRC
