* Building a cross-compiling DistCC farm

We're going to build a 16 core cross-compiling DistCC compiler farm on arm64 for fun and profit!
Well, ok, mostly fun. Let's start by running over the hardware that we've chosen for this process,
and some of the hardware we could have used. I'll try to be breif.

*** What I used

- [[https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=7147][Rock64]] board with 4GB RAM, 4 ARMv8 cores

*** What I have used before

- [[https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4][Odroid-XU4]] board with 2GB RAM, 8 ARMv7 cores

*** What I would like to use in the next iteration

- [[https://www.hardkernel.com/blog-2/odroid-n2/][Odroid N2]] board with 4GB RAM, 6 ARMv8 cores
- [[https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=61454][RockPro64]] board with 4GB RAM, 6 ARMv8 cores
