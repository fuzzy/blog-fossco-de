** What you'll find here

Little rants and ramblings about the stuff I play with. Should be a smattering of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]], [[https://golang.org][Golang]], and
[[https://www.python.org][Python]] articles, with some fun DevOps type stuff thrown in every now and then. I'll try my best not
to get into much in the way of politics, except where issues affect technology. If you're already
bored, here's a list of various blogs and such that I read that I find fun/useful: [[/org/misc/elfeed.org.org][RSS Feeds]] also [[/org/misc/bookmarks.org.org][My
bookmarks]].

** Maybe a little encouragement
